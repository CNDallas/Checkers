Be sure to import ../api/Evens with something such as:
const {MAKE_MOVE, RECEIVE_MOVE} = require('../api/Events')

you can make a move with socket.emit(MAKE_MOVE, fromX, fromY, toX, toY)
Note that this just sends a move to the opponent. All validity checks
are still client based
to receive a move use socket.on(RECEIVE_MOVE,fromX, fromY, toX, toY)

To run locally open a terminal and navigate to the working directory
start the server - npm run server
and then react - npm start
If it fails, check that port 8081 is available for the server. As of
right now the server is not smart enough to find an open port
