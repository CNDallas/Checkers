To access the users database, first download MySQL workbench.

Then use this address as the server: proj-319-048.misc.iastate.edu
user is rmhilby and password is black12

After logging in, the database is under factcheckers with a table called users.


Website is up and running at:
http://proj-319-048.misc.iastate.edu/

Individual pages need to be converted to react. Currently they are html with
scripts embeded. I will be making the change later tonight. 11/7/2018 12:20
